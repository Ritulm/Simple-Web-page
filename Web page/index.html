        <strong>His Career at Barcelona:</strong></h3><br>

      <ul class="small-font text-left black-text">
        <li><strong><u>2003-05</u><strong>: Rise to the first team</li>
          <p>During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five teams in a single campaign.</p>
          <li><strong><u>2005-08</u></strong>: Making the starting eleven</li>
          <p>On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player.</p>
        <li><strong><u>2008-09</u></strong>: Winning the sextuple</li>
          <p>Barça's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as they became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year.</p>
        <li><strong><u>2010-11</u></strong>: Continued success</li>
          <p>At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the greatest voting margin in each trophy's history.</p>
        <li><strong><u>2012</u></strong>: A record-breaking year</li>
          <p>20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.</p>
        <li><strong><u>2013-14</u></strong>: Messidependence</li>
          <p>Barcelona lost 7-0 on aggregate to Bayern Munchen. These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.</p>
          <li><strong><u>2015</u></strong>: A historic treble</li>
          <p>Messi capped off the year by opening the scoring in the 36th minute of the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona went on to defeat River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama, and winning the tournament's Silver Ball, despite missing the semi-final.</p>
        <li><strong><u>2016</u></strong>: 5th Ballon d'Or</li>
          <p>Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his career.</p>
